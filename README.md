# ___agram
Diamond Hacks Project for Spring 2024

## Concept
A word is displayed as an anagram and the user attempts to guess the original word as fast as possible.

## Implementation
User can either choose a given category or create their own custom category and word options to begin.
An anagram of a random word in the given category is displayed and a timer begins.
The user has infinite attempts to guess the word, and once they guess the correct word, the timer stops and reveals their time.
